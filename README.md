## Benchmarking Algorithms and Graphing with Plotly

### Expand the accordion for details on each of the algorithms

### Click the buttons on the benchmarking.html page to execute the timing and graphing script

### The first button allows the user to benchmark all three algorithms against each other

##### NOTE: BubbleSort is very slow, so this could take a couple minutes

### The second button allows the user to benchmark HeapSort and MergeSort against each other

##### NOTE: HeapSort and MergeSort are much faster and can handle much larger inputs than BubbleSort. As such, I wanted to allow the user to benchmark these two faster algorithms against each other

### Open the console prior to clicking the buttons for helpful output

### Mouse-over the graph for helpful tooltips

##### NOTE: When benchmarking Heap and MergeSort many of the data points are clustered near the origin

##### NOTE: Runtime measured in seconds
